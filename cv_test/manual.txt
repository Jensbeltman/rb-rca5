!!!NOTICE!!!
All images in a dataset must have at least one circle registered in it for the main program to not go out of sync.

1.
Place a number of images with any names (ending in .png) in the directory "datasets/buildDataset/".

2.
From within the directory "buildDataset" first run the script "rename_img.sh".

3.
Compile and run the main program from the "root" directory (the directory this file is in).

4.
Choose the option to build a dataset.

5.
After the first image is loaded it is required to press "space" (or any other key) to be able to proceed.

6.
Now click on the centrum of a circle in the image and then on the perimeter.

7.
    a - If satisfied with the circle press "s" to save the parameters.
    b - If not satisfied with the circle press "r" to retry.

When all circles in the image have been saved press "n" to go to the next image.

- Notice -
It is required to press "r" to redo a selection to avoid saving multiple circles if the next one is saved.
If "n" is pressed without saving any circles on the image the dataset will have to be redone!

8.
Go back to the directory "datasets/buildDataset/" and run the script "setDone.sh" with a number as parameter.
This number will serve as index for the folder that will be created in the directory "datasets".
The script "setDone.sh" will move all the images into the folder with the index chosen.

9.
If multiple datasets are being created repeat from step 1.

10.
Go back to the "root" directory (the directory with the main program and this file).
Run the main program and choose the option to run the test.
After running the weighted parameters will be placed in a file named "parameters.txt" in the same directory as the main program.
